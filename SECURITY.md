## Scope

PanaVista runs entirely locally within your Home Assistant instance. It does not make external network requests or store data outside your HA installation. Security concerns are primarily related to:

- Input validation in configuration flows
- Frontend XSS prevention
- Safe handling of calendar entity data
- Proper use of Home Assistant authentication and authorization

We follow coordinated disclosure. Please allow reasonable time for a fix before publishing details publicly.
