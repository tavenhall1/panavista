2. Open a new issue with:
   - Home Assistant version
   - PanaVista version
   - Browser and device info
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features

3. Include mockups or examples if possible

### Submitting Code

4. **Test locally** in a Home Assistant instance

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include screenshots for any UI changes
- Ensure frontend builds without errors (`cd custom_components/panavista/frontend && npm run build`)
- Don't introduce breaking changes without discussion first
- Update documentation if your change affects user-facing behavior
