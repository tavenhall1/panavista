## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Calendars

Make sure you have at least one calendar integration configured:

- **[Google Calendar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google/)** — Settings > Integrations > Google Calendar
- **Local Calendar** — Settings > Integrations > Local Calendar
- Any integration that creates `calendar.*` entities

### 2. Install PanaVista

#### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** (not Frontend)
3. Click the **three-dot menu** (top right) and select **Custom repositories**
4. Add this repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/tavenhall1/panavista
   ```
5. Set category to **Integration** and click **Add**
6. Search for **PanaVista Calendar** and click **Download**
7. **Restart Home Assistant**

#### Manual

1. Download the `custom_components/panavista` folder from this repository
2. Copy it into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

### 3. Add the PanaVista Integration

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **PanaVista Calendar**
4. Follow the single-step setup (calendars are auto-discovered)

### 4. Add the Card to a Dashboard

1. Open your dashboard and click **Edit**
2. Click **Add Card**
3. Search for **PanaVista Calendar**
4. Save — the onboarding wizard will appear on first load

The wizard walks you through preferences, calendar personalization (name, color, avatar), and theme selection. No YAML required.

### 5. Card YAML Options (Optional)

The card works with zero configuration, but you can override settings per-card:

```yaml
type: custom:panavista-calendar-card
entity: sensor.panavista_config

# Optional overrides
default_view: week          # day | week | month | agenda
calendars:                  # show only specific calendars
  - calendar.alice
  - calendar.bob
hide_weather: false         # hide the weather widget
hide_header: false          # hide the entire header bar
weather_entity: weather.home
time_format: 12h            # 12h | 24h
first_day: sunday           # sunday | monday
```

## Google Calendar Integration

PanaVista goes beyond Home Assistant's built-in calendar services to provide deep Google Calendar API integration for families sharing events.

- **Attendee Invitations** — When creating events on multiple calendars, PanaVista invites attendees via the Google Calendar API so events stay properly linked
- **In-Place Event Editing** — Shared events are updated via PATCH requests, preserving event links and attendee lists (no delete-and-recreate)
- **Real Organizer Detection** — Each event's true organizer is fetched from the Google Calendar API, enabling accurate "who created this?" display
- **Shared Event Deduplication** — When the same event appears on multiple family members' calendars, PanaVista detects and displays it once with participant indicators
- **Smart Delete** — The organizer sees "Delete Event" (removes for everyone); attendees see "Remove Me" (removes only their copy)
- **Graceful Fallback** — Non-Google calendars (Local Calendar, CalDAV, etc.) work normally using standard Home Assistant services

---

## Themes

PanaVista ships with four built-in themes: **Light**, **Dark**, **Minimal**, and **Vibrant**.

On top of any base theme, you can customize:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Accent Color** | Any color from the 20-swatch palette or custom picker |
| **Background** | Base default or custom hex color |
| **Header Style** | Purple, Teal, Sunset, Solid Accent, Solid Dark, or custom color |
| **Corners** | Sharp (4px), Rounded (12px), Pill (20px) |
| **Shadows** | None, Subtle, Bold |

Open the gear icon on the card header to access the settings panel and theme customizer. Changes preview live on the calendar behind the panel.

---

## Managing Events

### Creating Events

1. Click the **+ New** button in the card header (or the "+ Add" button on any day in week/agenda view)
2. Enter a title, select one or more calendars, and pick start/end times
3. Optionally add a location (autocomplete via OpenStreetMap sorted by distance) or description
4. Click **Add** — for multi-calendar events on Google Calendar, attendees are automatically invited via the API

### Editing Events

- Tap any event to open its detail popup, then click **Edit**
- For shared Google Calendar events, edits are applied in-place via PATCH — no need to delete and recreate
- All fields are editable: title, time, location, description, and calendar
- Guests can be added or removed when editing shared events

### Deleting Events

- From the event detail popup, click **Delete**
- If you're the organizer, the event is deleted for all attendees
- If you're an attendee, you're removed from the event without affecting others

Events sync two-way with your calendar provider (Google Calendar, Local Calendar, etc.).
